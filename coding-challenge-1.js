// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is 
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg 
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables

let johnWeight = 78;
let johnHeight = 1.69;

let markWeight = 95;
let markHeight = 1.88;


// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)

const johnBMI = (johnWeight / (johnHeight ** 2));
const markBMI = ((markWeight / (markHeight * markHeight)));

console.log(johnBMI);
console.log(markBMI);
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 
// m tall.
